# NOVA, a minimal Framework for PHP
To get your database connection up and running, just drop your DB credentials into the /config/config.ini file.
Note that Right now, the setup only supports MySQL. More database options are on the roadmap, so stay tuned!

If you’ve got ideas or want to help make the MINI-Framework better, contributions are totally welcome! Just a quick note—this framework is meant to give web developers a simple, no-fuss starting point for building new websites, without relying on big, heavy frameworks or libraries.
